# TriviaGame
This is a Game of Thrones themed trivia game centered around JavaScript timeouts and intervals.  When the user starts the game they have 15 seconds to anwer correctly.  Depending on if the user guesses correctly, incorrectly, or if the time runs out a different gif will play.  The timer is built using an interval and each gif plays for 2.5 seconds until a timeout is called.  After the end of the game the user's score is displayed and they have the option to play again.
